The rules are simple: Click on the switches to guide the trains to the right destinations (indicated by color).
It starts slowly but gets faster and harder over time. Hurry up to set up the correct path!

## Settings

There are settings to adapt the difficulty. If you play in a "placid mode", you collect points slower, though.
